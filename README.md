# Number plate checker

This service is a very simple regex page that will check if a numberplate (License plate) matches the UK requirement set by the DVLA. It doesn't check whether the plate is actually in use just performs a basic check.


## Intention

This is going to be part of a wider use for basic services that will be linked together for functions you sometimes need but don't exist on the web without an insane amount of ads
